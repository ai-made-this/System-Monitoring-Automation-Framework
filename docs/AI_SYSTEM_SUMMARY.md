## üöÄ Key AI Capabilities

### Habit Learning & Analysis

```python
# Examples of what the AI learns:
- "User is most active 9 AM - 6 PM with peaks at 10-11 AM and 2-3 PM"
- "Chrome usage: 45%, VS Code: 20%, peak memory usage at 2 PM"
- "Typing patterns: 65 WPM average, heavy shortcut usage"
- "Resource patterns: High CPU during work hours, GPU spikes evenings"
```

### Natural Language Queries

```python
# Supported query examples:
"Why is my CPU usage high at 3 PM?"
‚Üí "High CPU usage detected during work hours. Primary causes: browser with multiple tabs, background processes. Peak usage 14:00-16:00."

"When do I use the most memory?"
‚Üí "Memory usage peaks between 10 AM and 4 PM, with highest usage around 2 PM (78% average)."

"What apps do I use most often?"
‚Üí "Most used: Chrome (45%), VS Code (20%), File Explorer (15%), Notepad (10%)"
```

### Predictive Intelligence

```python
# Prediction examples:
- Resource Usage: "High CPU predicted next 2 hours (work hours pattern)"
- Maintenance: "System restart recommended in next 24 hours for optimization"
- User Activity: "Low activity predicted early morning (before 8 AM)"
```

### Autonomous Control Features

```python
# Safety features for "take the reins":
- Emergency stop via ESC key
- Time limits (1 hour default, 4 hour max)
- Application whitelist for security
- User confirmation for sensitive operations
- Detailed activity logging
```

## üîÑ AI Data Flow

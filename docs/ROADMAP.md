# Implementation Roadmap

This document outlines the major implementation and setup tasks required to make the System Monitoring & Automation Framework fully operational, based on its proof-of-concept design.

## Phase 1: Core Module Implementation (Connecting to Real Data)

This phase involves replacing all the simulated data placeholders in the various modules with code that calls real system libraries.

- [ ] **Hardware & Performance Monitoring:**
  - **Goal:** Get real-time data for CPU, GPU, Memory, Network, and Storage.
  - **Libraries:** `psutil`, `GPUtil`.
  - **Target Modules:** `modes/cpu/`, `modes/gpu/`, `modes/memory/`, `modes/network/`, `modes/storage/`, `modes/performance/`.

- [ ] **Audio Processing:**
  - **Goal:** Capture and analyze real audio from system devices.
  - **Libraries:** `pyaudio`, `sounddevice`, `pycaw`.
  - **Target Modules:** `modes/audio/`.

- [ ] **System & Application Interaction:**
  - **Goal:** Get data about running processes, the active window, and browser tabs.
  - **Libraries:** `psutil`, `pywin32`.
  - **Target Modules:** `modes/applications/`, `modes/system/`.

- [ ] **Visual Processing & OCR:**
  - **Goal:** Enable screen capture, image analysis, and text recognition (OCR).
  - **Libraries:** `opencv-python`, `pillow`, `pytesseract`.
  - **Target Modules:** `modes/visual/`.

- [ ] **System Control & Automation:**
  - **Goal:** Allow the framework to perform actions like managing processes or changing system settings.
  - **Libraries:** `pywin32`, `wmi`.
  - **Target Modules:** `modes/system_control/`, `modes/automation/`.

## Phase 2: AI & Machine Learning Integration

Once real data is flowing from Phase 1, the AI/ML framework can be brought to life.

- [ ] **Implement ML Models:**
  - **Goal:** Replace placeholder AI logic with actual learning models.
  - **Libraries:** `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`, `pytorch`.
  - **Target Modules:** `modes/ai/`, `modes/ml/`.

- [ ] **Build Learning Pipeline:**
  - **Goal:** Create the system that continuously feeds data from the monitoring modules into the ML models for real-time training and prediction.

- [ ] **Develop Analysis Algorithms:**
  - **Goal:** Implement the logic for habit analysis, pattern recognition, and predictive modeling.

## Phase 3: Testing and Validation

With the core features and AI implemented, the focus shifts to stability and reliability.

- [ ] **Unit & Integration Testing:**
  - **Goal:** Write tests to ensure individual modules work correctly and that they work together without issues.
  - **Framework:** `pytest`.

- [ ] **Performance Benchmarking:**
  - **Goal:** Measure the framework's resource usage (CPU, memory) to ensure it runs efficiently in the background.

- [ ] **Security Audit:**
  - **Goal:** Review all system control and automation features to ensure they cannot be exploited.

## Phase 4: Production Readiness

The final phase involves polishing the project for real-world use.

- [ ] **Robust Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling and logging throughout the application.
- [ ] **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Test and adapt the code to run on other operating systems if desired (currently Windows-focused).
- [ ] **User Documentation:** Create detailed guides for end-users.
